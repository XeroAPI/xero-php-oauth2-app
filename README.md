# Xero PHP oAuth 2 App
This PHP project demonstrates how to use the xero-php-oauth2 SDK.  Use composer or clone this repository to your local machine to begin.

You'll be able to connect to a Xero Organisation, make real API calls. The code used to make each API call will be displayed along with the results returned from Xero's API.

## Getting Started
To run locally, you'll need a local web server with PHP support.  
* MAMP is a good option [Download MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) 

### Download Manually
* Clone this repo into your local server webroot. 
* Launch a terminal app and change to the newly cloned folder `xero-php-oauth2-app`
* Download dependencies with Composer using the following command

```
composer install
```

## Create a Xero App
To obtain your API keys, follow these steps and create a Xero app

* Create a [free Xero user account](https://www.xero.com/us/signup/api/) (if you don't have one)
* Login to [Xero developer center](https://developer.xero.com/myapps)
* Click "New App" link
* Enter your App name, company url, privacy policy url.
* Enter the redirect URI (your callback url - i.e. `http://localhost:8888/xero-php-oauth2-app/callback.php`)
* Agree to terms and condition and click "Create App".
* Click "Generate a secret" button.
* Copy your client id and client secret and save for use later.
* Click the "Save" button. You secret is now hidden.

## Configure your .env file
You'll need to setup your  `.env` file

Rename the file `sample.env` to `.env` and copy and paste your *clientId, clientSecret and redirectUri*  These .env variables will be read by authorization.php, callback.php, get.php.

Sample.env file
```bash
CLIENT_ID = "YOUR-CLIENT-ID"
CLIENT_SECRET = "YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET"
REDIRECT_URI = "http://localhost:8888/xero-php-oauth2-app/callback.php"
```

Sample PHP code from authorization.php
```php
// This library will read variable from the .env file.
$dotenv = Dotenv\Dotenv::createImmutable(__DIR__);
$dotenv->load();
$clientId = getenv('CLIENT_ID');
$clientSecret = getenv('CLIENT_SECRET');
$redirectUri = getenv('REDIRECT_URI');

$provider = new \League\OAuth2\Client\Provider\GenericProvider([
	'clientId'                => $clientId,   
	'clientSecret'            => $clientSecret,
	'redirectUri'             => $redirectUri,
	'urlAuthorize'            => 'https://login.xero.com/identity/connect/authorize',
	'urlAccessToken'          => 'https://identity.xero.com/connect/token',
	'urlResourceOwnerDetails' => 'https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Organisation'
]);

```

## docker-compose
* Have Docker & Docker Compose installed - https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Run `docker-compose up` in the root directory of this repository to launch a local server.
The server will be published to port `8080` by default:

    http://localhost:8080/
    
The redirect URL will be `http://localhost:8080/callback.php`, which must be
set in the configuration of this demo application and within your Xero app.

The local port can be changed through the `APP_HTTP_PORT` variable in the
environment or set in `.env`.
You may want to do this if port `8080` is already in use.
